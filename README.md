# ComputerVision_MidTermProjectProposal
THEFT PREVENTION using a Computer Vision Solution 

Team: Khalida Bestani, Malcolm Richardson, R. Brandon Thompson

This repository contains a project proposal to a real world solution. 

Analyze, detect and alert. Veesion uses Video Deep Learning

Object Detection (OD) and Action Recognition (AR) to detect people and identify their behavior. Just watching people is not enough. OD to detect people and products. AR to identify suspicious behavior, "theft" and track the suspects throughout the store. Neuroevolution to evolve from new data and improve continuosly. Evolutionary Video Deep Learning learns patterns but evolves better architecture or strategies for learning those patterns.

Deep spatiotemporal learning and continual learning through:
Convolutional 3D Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Video Tranformers

UCF-Crime or Anomaly Detection datasets - has actual suspicious behavior videos
COCO - has people, bags, products (good starting point)
Roboflow - search for "shoplifting detection" or "retail security" datasets



## Used Claude AI for insight on what models Veesion and other top companies are using for retail prevention with AI. Claude provided a breakdown of the models used, ML domains, architectures and examples of real world use cases outside of retail theft prevention.
