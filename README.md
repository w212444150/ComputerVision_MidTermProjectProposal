# ComputerVision_MidTermProjectProposal

Tier 3 + justification

Problem Statement (2â€“3 sentences) Museums lost over $5 billion last year to thefts and damages. Traditional security systems are too expensive and cannot monitor every exhibit at all times and respond fast enough to prevent loss or damage. There is an urgent need for affordable real-time security that prevents loss and damage before it happens for institutions of all sizes.

Solution Overview: THEFT PREVENTION using a Computer Vision Solution that spots when someone is getting too close to the exhibits or is acting suspicious. The model identifies threatening or sketchy behavior, filters out false alarms while verifying actual threats to then alert security in real time. 

Team: Khalida Bestani, Malcolm Richardson, R. Brandon Thompson

This repository contains a project proposal to a real world solution. 

Analyze, detect and alert. Veesion uses Video Deep Learning

Object Detection (OD) and Action Recognition (AR) to detect people and identify their behavior. Just watching people is not enough. OD to detect people and products. AR to identify suspicious behavior, "theft" and track the suspects throughout the building(s). Neuroevolution to evolve from new data and improve continuosly. Evolutionary Video Deep Learning learns patterns that evolves better architecture or strategies for learning those patterns.

Deep spatiotemporal learning and continual learning through:
Convolutional 3D Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Video Tranformers

UCF-Crime or Anomaly Detection datasets - has actual suspicious behavior videos
COCO - has people, bags, products (good starting point)
Roboflow - search for "shoplifting detection" or "retail security" datasets
Unity Perception - synthetic datasets that allow us to generate correct labels that would be difficult to get in actual museums.Can build "scenes" for bounding box and labeler to capture boundaries, person crossing boundaries, hands, gestures, artifacts, reaching, bags, etc







Technical Approach (technique, model, framework)

Dataset Plan (source, size, labels, link if public)

Metrics (primary + secondary)

Week-by-Week Plan

Resources Needed (compute, cost, APIs)

Risks & Mitigation Table

Risk	Probability	Mitigation
Low accuracy	Medium	Use data augmentation
Missing data	High	Switch to Roboflow dataset






## Used Claude AI for insight on what models Veesion and other top companies are using for retail prevention with AI. Claude provided a breakdown of the models used, ML domains, architectures and examples of real world use cases outside of retail theft prevention.
## Copilot was used to design powerpoint slides. ChatGPT was utilized to provide information on the best datasets and how/when to implement them into training, testing or fine-tuning stages.
